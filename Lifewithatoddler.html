	<p> My 18 month old is growing up so fast! She has <b> 15</b> teeth already and loves to <i>sing.</i>
		<p>Motherhood is the best journey i have ever been on! I have always wanted to be a mom. But that doesn’t mean that everyday is easy or all rainbows and butterflies either. This part of my page will consist of our summer adventures and tips and tricks that I have found to be helpful along this journey of <i>“Life with a toddler”</i> 
	<h2> Trip #1</h2>
<p> Recently, I took my daughter to a place called <i> Monkey Joe's</i> in Lexington Ky. Monkey Joe's is an indoor inflatabel gym for children. There are also arcade games and they have food. My daughter <b>LOVED</b> the toddler area as well. There was a floor piano that she played on for at least 15 minutes alone. Pricing is pretty good for the time that my daughter wanted to be there. The only downside is it can get pretty busy and the food isn't the best quality, but what can you ask for when you are at an indoor play gym?

	<h3> Trip #2</h3>
	<center><img style=padding:10px;"" align="left" src="hoggys.jpeg"height="450" width= "450"/></center>
	<p>My husband and I lived in Frankfort Ky the first two years of our relationship. We like to go back and explore around town sometimes. We decided to take our daughter to dowtown Frankfort last weekend. We walked throughout the historic downtown shopping area and showed her around our old stomping grounds. Then we finished our day with ice cream at a local shop called <i>Hoggy's Ice Cream</i>If you are ever in Frankfort this is a place you should go! They make homemade ice cream and they even have pineapple dole whip that is a close second to the Disney World original!The mascot of the shop is a <Bold>Pink Pig</Bold> which my daughter loved!
