	<p> One thing that I have been doing since high school is baking. I <BOLD> LOVE</BOLD> to bake cupcakes, cakes, brownies, and cobblers. While I was in college I even sold a few dozen cupcakes on the side to make some extra money. Now, I only bake for fun and as a stress relief during the craziness of raising a toddler. </p>

	<P> Cupcakes are just such a fun little handheld bite of cake! I love them and love baking and decorating them!</p>
	<P>Another one of my favorite things to bake is Homemade Cinnamon Rolls! I have actually statrted making them with pizza dough! You simple roll out the dough, put butter on the dough, sprink cinnamon and brown sugar, and then roll and cut!Pretty simple concept. I always bake mine in a round pan so that they rise together. Which just makes them look so yummy before you even start to eat!</p>
