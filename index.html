	<p>Hi, I'm <b> Tori!</b> This is the first time I have made a page like this. But I am going to try.. <br> MY BEST!</br> This website will serve as a lifestyle page. From <b> Cooking</b>, <b>baking</b>, <b>Raising a toddler</b> and all things in between. 
		<p>Hi! I’m Tori, a teacher, mom, wife, and lover of all things baking and cooking! I decided to start this lifestyle blog as a way to hopefully help other mom’s who might be struggling with idea of things to do with their toddlers and or new recipes or dinners on a crazy hectic night. If that sounds like something you would be interested in reading about then continue on throughout my page! I Hope you find something helpful. Remember we are all learning as we go!
