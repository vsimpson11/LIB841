	<p> Cooking is something that I grew up doing with my mom and my grandma. I am so excited that I now have a daughter I can pass the cooking tradition on to. On this page you will find recipes for the week, and how my <BOLD>toddler</BOLD> enjoys each meal so you could try it with your toddler as well.</p>

	<p>This week, I made one of my husbands favorite chicken recipes, Mississippi Chicken! I know that this chicken doesn't look like much in the first photo, but I promise this is the BEST chicken! You need the following ingredients
		<Ul>
			<LI> Chicken Breast</LI>
			<LI>1 Ranch Dressing Packet</LI>
			<LI> 1 Au Jus Gravy Mix</LI>	
			<LI> Salt and Pepper</LI>
			<LI> Banana Peppers</LI>
			<LI> Butter</LI>
			<LI> Cheese Slices. I prefer Colby Jack or Pepper Jack!</LI>
		</a></LI>
	<p> You will season your chicken with salt & pepper,the ranch dressing, and the gravy mix. Then place Banana Peppers on top and cute thin slices of butter on top. I bake mine at 450 for about 35-45 minutes depending on the size of the chicken breast. Once cooked, top the chicken with the cheese slices and place back in the oven until melted. I normally serve with rice. Such a <i> yummy</i> meal!
